## Terros-Real-Estate-Agency-Project
- Terro’s real-estate is an agency that estimates the pricing of houses in a certain locality. The pricing is concluded based on different features / factors of a property. This also helps them in identifying the business value of a property. To do this activity the company employs an “Auditor”, who studies various geographic features of a property like pollution level (NOX), crime rate, education facilities (pupil to teacher ratio), connectivity (distance from highway), etc. This helps in determining the price of a property.The agency has provided a dataset of 506 houses in Boston.

- Your job, as an auditor, is to analyze the magnitude of each variable to which it can affect the price of a house in a particular locality.
